# Double-CRISPR Knockout Simulation (DKOsim)
DKOsim is a simulation framework designed to simulate growth-based dual knockout CRISPR screens. It allows users and investigators to reproducibly generate synthetic data where both the single gene fitness effect and the interaction of gene pairs can be pre-specified.

This page contains the R source code downloadable to generate the simulated synthetic CRISPR screening data, and examples of analyzing the simulations are organized in jupyter notebook.
